    "# Rock Coast Modelling Lab\r\n",
    "Geomorphic systems tend to develop slowly relative to the timescale of a human life. One way in which we can understand how landscapes change over longer timescales is to use computer models to simulate geomorphic processes. In this lab you will apply a simple model for how rock coasts develop over time. The model is referred to as \"simple\" because it relies on mathematical simplifications, and rules, to represent otherwise complex physics in an abstracted way. The advantage of such an approach is that we can change individual components (such as tidal range) and explore how it influences the development of rock coast morphology.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The model developed here is based on the work of Sunamura (1992), Trenahile (2000), Hurst et al. (2017), and Matsumoto et al. (2016), but has been kept to the basic critical components for the purposes of this lab. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The model is written in the Python computer programming language, but you don't need any prior knowledge of computer programming. The aims of this lab are\r\n",
    "* Understand how coastal processes can be represented numerically\r\n",
    "* Run the numerical model to simulate shore platform development\r\n",
    "* Explore the controls on how rapidly rock coasts evolve through time\r\n",
    "* Create and explain graphs/figures that demonstrate particular controls on shore platform morphology\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Python\r\n",
    "The programming language we are using in this lab is called Python. No prior knowledge of programming is required for this lab. Learning how to be a programmer is not the aim! However, this sort of scientific computing is becoming more common place in research and consultancy, so it won't do you any harm to see it in action. Python is multifunctional, for example it can interface with QGIS (software we will use un future labs) to automate workflows.\r\n",
